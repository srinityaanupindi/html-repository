<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Sri Nitya Anupindi, usually called Nitya. I’m learning web development and building this site as part of that journey.</p>

<p>I currently work in edtech, and I’m using this space to practise what I’m learning, try out ideas, and slowly put together a small corner of the internet that feels like “me.”</p>

<p>You’ll find experiments, projects, and anything else I end up creating as I learn. It’s all work-in-progress, but that’s part of the fun.</p>
