<h1>Nitya's Top 3 Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>Movies that make you feel good and keep you coming back no matter how many times you've watched them</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Yes, I know these are 3 movies and it's cheating, but it's 1 book, folks!</p>
<p>This is the ultimate marathon watchlist movie to have for when you have a nice long weekend or vacation. It's the ultimate story of the triumph of the good and the simple over evil. You won't regret this.</p>
<h3>The Intern</h3>
<p>This is the ultimate nice, quirky, fun, 'millennial' watch for a quick feel-good movie you want on a week night.</p>
<h3>Godavari</h3>
<p>This movie perfectly symbolises that lovely warm, rich hot chocolate on a stormy night. This is the ultimate feel-good without all the fantastical and mythical creatures of LOTR. It's your everyday boy-next-door meets girl-next-door movie, but it feels so soothing and slice of life, you feel like you're on the journey with the main characters.</p>
